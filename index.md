Just the Docs is a theme for generating static websites with [Jekyll]. You can write source files for your web pages using [Markdown], the [Liquid] templating language, and HTML.[^1] Jekyll builds your site by converting all files that have [front matter] to HTML. Your [Jekyll configuration] file determines which theme to use, and sets general parameters for your site, such as the URL of its home page.
